At the physical layer, communication is direct: 
device A sends a stream of bits to device B 
(through intermediate nodes). 
• At the higher layers, communication must move 
down through the layers on device A, over to 
device B, and then back up through the layers.
 • Each layer in the sending device adds its own 
information to the message it receives from the 
layer just above it and passes the whole 
package to the layer just below it. 
• At layer 1 the entire package is converted to a 
form that can be transmitted to the receiving 
device. 
• At the receiving machine, the message is 
unwrapped layer by layer, with each process 
receiving and removing the data meant for it.<strong>My name is Ashish</strong>
